    This message is primarily useful for clients that want to move their users

    messages.

    I might be worth to also broadcast these messages so clients can
    interpolate a user's movement.  ``move`` messages are however not fit to
    handle the actual movement of entities because clients may run with
    different speeds. The ``position`` message should be used instead.
